Below is a common fix if you want the entire level to truly restart after a failure, rather than just replaying the old pattern. The main issue is that in your current handleFailure method, you never call startNewLevel(). As a result, the code simply re-shows the existing pattern—so it may appear not to restart.

Why startNewLevel() Matters

Your startNewLevel() method does the following crucial things:
	1.	Generates a new pattern via PatternGenerator.generate(...).
	2.	Resets the player’s sequence and locks input until the new pattern is shown.
	3.	Updates the UI with the current level and tokens.
	4.	Calls this.showPattern() and re-enables input afterward.

If your goal on failure is to re-generate the pattern (effectively “restart the level”)—you must call startNewLevel(). Right now, handleFailure() just:

// Old code in handleFailure
await this.countdownManager.showCountdown();
await this.showPattern();

That replays the existing pattern array (this.patterns) you had before failing, meaning it isn’t truly “restarting.”

How to Fix: Call startNewLevel()

One straightforward fix is to remove (or comment out) the lines that do showCountdown() and showPattern() directly, and replace them with a call to startNewLevel(). For example:

private async handleFailure() {
    try {
        this.canInput = false;
        this.isShowingPattern = true;

        // Show failure message (some UI transition)
        await this.transitionManager.showFailure();
        
        // Reset player state
        this.playerSequence = [];
        this.isLongPressing = false;
        this.longPressIndex = -1;
        
        if (this.longPressTimer) {
            this.longPressTimer.destroy();
            this.longPressTimer = null;
        }

        // Reset circle visuals
        this.circles.forEach(circle => {
            circle.hideLongPressIndicator();
            circle.setActiveState(false);
            circle.setVisible(this.difficulty === 'novice');
        });

        // A short delay so the failure message is visible
        await new Promise(resolve => this.time.delayedCall(1000, resolve));
        
        // ►► Instead of manually re-showing the pattern,
        // call startNewLevel to truly regenerate everything:
        await this.startNewLevel();

        // Re-enable after the new level has been set up
        this.isShowingPattern = false;
        this.canInput = true;

    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error in handleFailure:', error);
        this.isShowingPattern = false;
        this.canInput = true;
    }
}

What This Does
	1.	Shows the failure UI and delays briefly.
	2.	Clears any long-press timers, circle states, etc.
	3.	Calls this.startNewLevel(), which:
	•	Resets patterns by calling PatternGenerator.generate(...).
	•	Updates UI (level, tokens).
	•	Shows the newly generated pattern.
	4.	Re-enables input only after the level is set.

Now your failed level will really restart: you get a fresh pattern, the UI is consistent, and the scene behaves like it does on first creation.

If You Need the Same Pattern Instead

If you want to replay the identical pattern (rather than generate a brand-new one), you can do one of two things:
	1.	Store the original pattern in some variable before playing it. Then restore that pattern in handleFailure().
	2.	Skip the line this.patterns = PatternGenerator.generate(...) inside startNewLevel(), or replace it with your own logic.

But usually you’ll want the fresh pattern so the level feels “restarted.” Hence, using startNewLevel() is the most common fix.

Summary
	•	The core issue is that handleFailure() never calls startNewLevel(), so it just replays the old pattern.
	•	Replace the manual lines that call this.showPattern() with a call to this.startNewLevel().
	•	This ensures the entire level logic resets (including pattern generation, UI updates, etc.).
